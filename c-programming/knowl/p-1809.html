<div class="para">You are still conducting linguistic research! This time, you’d like to find out how many letters occur multiple times in a given word. To do so, you will read a word from the input and then sort the letters of the word alphabetically (by their ASCII codes). Next, you go through the letters of the word and compare a letter with the one following it. If these equal each other, you increase a counter by 1, making sure to next skip ahead far enough so that letters that occur more than twice are not counted again. You may assume that the word you read from the input has no more than 50 letters.</div>
